# Study Guide

Topics Covered: Java

Review the material covered this week

Be able to answer "Tell me about your experience with X?"

Know how to switch between short answers and detailed answers. For example, if you're asked about the four pillars, provide as much detail as possible. If they ask you a more specific question, then think about whether to elaborate a lot or just to keep it short.

Also be able to provide the overall reasons of `why` something is done or why certain features are available, such as what problems they might solve.

- 4 Pillars of OOP
    - Abstraction
        - Abstract classes and interfaces
    - Polymorphism
        - Method overloading
            - "Compile-time polymorphism"
            - Set in stone at the time of compilation
        - Method Overriding
            - "Runtime polymorphism"
            - JVM figures out at runtime what implementation to execute based on the object the reference variable is pointing to
            - So if Animal a were pointing to Dog, `makeNoise()` would be different than if it were pointing to Cat
            - We can change whether it is pointing to Dog or to Cat at Runtime
        - Covariance
            - `Animal a = new Dog()`
    - Inheritance
        - IS-A relationship
        - Subclasses are more SPECIFIC
    - Encapsulation
        - getters/setters
        - private access modifiers
- Exceptions & Exception Handling
    - Keywords
        - throw: throwing the exception
            - `Exception e = new Exception()`
            - `throw e`
            - OR
            - `throw new Exception()`
        - throws: declaring that a method COULD potentially throw this exception
        - try
        - catch
            - Make sure more specific exceptions are listed first
            - So, for example, `catch (Exception e)` should go last if you have it, because it is the least specific
        - finally
    - Class hierarchy
        - Throwable
            - Exception: normal part of our programs
                - RuntimeException
                    - ArithmeticException
                    - NullPointerException
                    - IllegalArgumentException
                    - ClassCastException
                - IOException
                - ClassNotFoundException
            - Error: typically you shouldn't catch and handle errors, because errors usually mean something really bad has happened
                - StackOverflowError
                - OutOfMemoryError
    - Checked v. Unchecked exceptions
        - What differentiates the two?
            - Checked exceptions are required to be declared with the throws keyword, or handled with try-catch
            - Unchecked does not need to, but if you don't handle them, your program WILL crash
    - When do ALL exceptions occur?
        - AT RUNTIME
        - AT RUNTIME!!!

- JUnit
    - Unit testing library
    - Different from manual testing, here we do things using test cases that we write
    - Annotations
        - `@Test`
        - `@BeforeClass`
        - `@AfterClass`
        - `@Before`
